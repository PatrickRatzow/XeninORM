# XeninORM
XeninORM is an ORM for Garry's Mod. Written in LAUX and built to support both MySQLOO and SQLite at the same, internally abstracting the differences between them.

This project is heavily influenced by TypeORM, Doctrine, and Hibernate, borrowing some code from the former.

# Work in progress
This is still heavily WIP, not at all stable for any kind of production usage. You're welcome to contribute though
